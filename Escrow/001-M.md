# Tokens with Blocklist as USDC can prevent Seller or Arbiter from obtaining the funds.
## Severity
Medium Risk

## Summary
USDC token is implementing admin owned blocklist, which prevents users from sending/obtaining funds in this Token.

## Vulnerability Details
In case when SELLER or ARBITER does not know that they are not USDC blocklist, it can happen shortly before creating an Escrow. There is no check for this kind of blocklist in the escrow contract. The funds get stuck in Escrow.

I add here this vulnerability as USDC is a commonly used token, and also it was told that it will be used in Escrows.

## Impact
Escrow does not check if the Seller or Arbiter occurs on this blocklist. It will prevent the Seller or Arbiter from obtaining the funds.

## Proof of concept
I created a Simple POC to imagine this situation, where I took some functionality from Escrow to test to have it in one place. The test below prevents confirmReceipt functionality as the seller is in blocklist.
```Solidity
mapping(address => bool) public blacklist;

    function blackList(address addr) public returns (bool) {
        return blacklist[addr];
    }

    function transfer(address to) internal {
        if (blackList(to)) {
            revert("User blacklisted");
        }
        ERC20Mock(address(i_tokenContract)).mint(SELLER, PRICE);
    }

    function testBlacklisted() public {
        blacklist[SELLER] = true;
        vm.startPrank(BUYER);
        ERC20Mock(address(i_tokenContract)).mint(BUYER, PRICE);
        ERC20Mock(address(i_tokenContract)).approve(
            address(escrowFactory),
            PRICE
        );
        escrow = escrowFactory.newEscrow(
            PRICE,
            i_tokenContract,
            SELLER,
            ARBITER,
            ARBITER_FEE,
            SALT1
        );
        vm.stopPrank();
        // This test contract is Escrow
        ERC20Mock(address(i_tokenContract)).mint(address(this), PRICE);
        transfer(SELLER); // This is going to revert
    }
Tools Used
Manual review.
```
## Recommendations
Add check for blocklist if the Token which is used in Escrow is USDC in the constructor of Escrow.
